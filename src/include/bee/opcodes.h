/* Instructions occupy a word, and take the following forms:

   32-bit Bee:

   1. Opcode in bits 0-1, rest of word is immediate operand.
      The opcodes are BEE_OP_* below masked with BEE_OP1_MASK.
   2. Bits 0-1 are 11, opcode in bits 2-3, rest of word is immediate operand.
      The opcodes are BEE_OP_* below masked with BEE_OP2_MASK.
   3. Bits 0-3 are 1111, rest of word is instruction opcode.
      The opcodes are BEE_INSN_* below.

   64-bit Bee:

   1. Opcode in bits 0-2, rest of word is immediate operand.
      The opcodes are BEE_OP_* below masked with BEE_OP1_MASK == BEE_OP2_MASK.
   2. Bits 0-3 are 111, rest of word is instruction opcode.
      The opcodes are BEE_INSN_* below.
